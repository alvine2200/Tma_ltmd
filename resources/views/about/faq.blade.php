                                You need to want to be a model and be committed to achieving it! It might sound obvious but it
                                is amazing how many prospective models realize they can't do a shoot for many weeks and then
                                give up. Having the right look and figure is also important but without determination you will
                                not succeed. If you want to be a model, then you should always be professional in your attitude.
                                If you provide a phone number or email address you should always return contact promptly.

                                Different types of modeling have different requirements. For example, catwalk has some
                                specific requirements for size. At least, You need to be at 5'9" height to suit to that type and if
                                you are less than 5'9" it will be extremely difficult for you to model full time. The requirements
                                for glamour, commercial modeling are far more relaxed.

                                There are some key shots that you need as a model so that potential clients know what you look
                                like. These include a clear headshot and full height picture. If looking for lingerie and glamour
                                work, then this should also include a bikini or lingerie photo.

                                It all depends on what area of modeling you are interested in and robust for. This is why we
                                break down each major area of chance and give you comprehensive answers for each particular
                                area. Some models are not tall and thin yet can construct a good income from the industry as a
                                commercial print or lifestyle model.

                                No. This causes conflict between agents and confuses clients when trying to book talent.
                                However, we do offer this option to our high value models in larger markets with our agency

                                First, you need to be on our Green List. Most of our talent does both modeling and acting (even
                                if the acting is for non-speaking video work). For modeling, you will need: Photos in a portfolio
                                that show a variety of looks A composite card, which is usually a 6′′ x 8” card with photos front
                                and back, your name and stats. For acting and on-camera video work, you will need: An 8 x 10
                                commercial head shot and a Resume. In both cases an online presence is very beneficial and
                                clients increasingly rely on finding models and actors using online portfolios.

                                Rates for talent vary from client to client. Sometimes you are paid hourly and sometimes by the
                                day. Each job is different. Full details of the job are sent to you before the assignment.

                                Yes, it is very possible to be a TMA model and be a student or profession at the same time. It will
                                require you to be extremely organized and good with time management to accommodate both
